# Wasteland Reforged

_An open-source implementation of the classic Wasteland gamemode for Arma Reforger._

## Summary

_**Wasteland Reforged**_ is a fully open-source adaptation of Wasteland, the iconic PvPvE sandbox gamemode from previous Arma titles, for Arma Reforger and future installments in the Arma series.

Originally created by Tonic in 2012, Wasteland was and is one of the most popular game modes available in Arma, being a staple gamemode of Arma 2 and Arma 3. The Wasteland Reforged project aims to bring that experience into the modern era of Arma Reforger by providing a customizable framework that allows players and communities to tailor gameplay mechanics, host their own servers, and expand upon the original vision.
