# Wasteland Reforged

_An open-source implementation of the classic Wasteland gamemode for Arma Reforger._

## Summary

_**Wasteland Reforged**_ is a fully open-source adaptation of Wasteland, the iconic PvPvE sandbox gamemode from previous Arma titles, for Arma Reforger and future installments in the Arma series.

Originally created by Tonic in 2012, Wasteland is one of the most popular gamemodes available in Arma, being a staple of Arma 2 and Arma 3. The Wasteland Reforged project aims to bring that experience into the modern era of Arma Reforger by providing a customizable framework that allows players and communities to host their own servers, tailor gameplay mechanics to their liking, and ultimately expand upon the original vision.

## Community

Development of Wasteland Reforged is led by [Paul](https://github.com/paul2kandrews) and [Choco](https://github.com/echurchill1), owners of _Armageddon Gaming_.  

From 2018 to 2021 we built a thriving Wasteland community in Arma 3 based on a customized version of the open-source [A3Wasteland](http://a3wasteland.com/) mission. Now we’re hard at work carrying the gamemode forward into Arma Reforger and beyond, passing the torch to future generations of Arma players by giving them the ability to freely host and customize Wasteland.

Join the Armageddon Gaming [Discord server](https://discord.gg/6taFAJP) to get involved in the Wasteland Reforged community and keep up with the project. You can also find information there on how to customize the mod for your own server or contribute to the source code.
