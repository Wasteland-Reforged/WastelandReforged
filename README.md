# Wasteland Reforged

An open-source implementation of the classic Wasteland gamemode for Arma Reforger.

## Summary

Wasteland Reforged is an adaptation of Wasteland, the iconic PvPvE sandbox gamemode, for Arma Reforger and future installments in the Arma series.

Originally created by Tonic in 2012, Wasteland is one of the most popular game modes available in Arma, being a staple gamemode of Arma 2 and Arma 3. The Wasteland Reforged project aims to bring that experience into the modern era of Arma Reforger by providing a customizable framework that allows players and communities to tailor gameplay mechanics, host their own servers, and expand upon the original vision.
